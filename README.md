## Description

This project is designed to simulate the behavior of a frontend application, focusing on key concepts like **state management**, **backend interaction simulation**, and **user experience improvements**. The goal is to demonstrate clean code architecture, a thoughtful approach to state management, and effective simulation of backend services.

The application simulates interactions between the frontend and backend, such as fetching and updating data. The project is built with modern frontend technologies and showcases how you would structure an application for scalability and maintainability.

### Key Features:
- **Simulated Backend**: Interacts with a mock backend service to simulate data fetching and updates.
- **State Management**: Efficient state management across different components using a consistent state management solution.
- **Error Handling and Loading States**: Thoughtful UX improvements like error handling, loading indicators, and form validation.
- **Responsive Design**: The application is designed to be responsive and accessible, ensuring a smooth experience across devices.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React
- **State Management**: Redux (or React Context API)
- **Backend Simulation**: JSON Server (simulates REST API interactions)
- **UI Library**: Material-UI (for pre-built components and styles)
- **Testing**: Jest (for unit and integration tests)

## Installation and Setup

Follow these instructions to set up and run the project locally:

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/frontend-evaluation-challenge.git
cd frontend-evaluation-challenge
```

### 2. Install dependencies

Run the following command to install all the required dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Start the development server

Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the development server by running:

```bash
npm start
```

This will launch the project in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

### 4. Simulate the Backend

To simulate the backend, we use JSON Server. To start the mock API:

```bash
npm run server
```

This will run a mock backend at `http://localhost:5000`, providing simulated data for the frontend application.

### 5. Running Tests

The project includes automated tests written using Jest. You can run the tests with the following command:

```bash
npm test
```

This will execute the test suite and display the results in your terminal.

## Project Structure

Here is an overview of the project structure:

```
/src
  /components         # React components
  /pages             # Page components (home, about, etc.)
  /redux             # Redux store, reducers, and actions
  /api               # API simulation (mock server and API utilities)
  /styles            # CSS/SCSS files or Material-UI theme
  /utils             # Utility functions or helpers
  /tests             # Unit and integration tests
```

## Assumptions & Design Decisions

- **State Management**: The project uses **Redux** to manage application-level state across multiple components. This ensures a single source of truth and efficient state updates.
- **Backend Simulation**: A mock backend using **JSON Server** is used to simulate real-world API interactions. This mock backend provides data for users, tasks, and other simulated resources.
- **UX Improvements**: Beyond the core functionality, extra attention has been paid to user experience:
  - Loading indicators while data is being fetched from the simulated API.
  - Error handling when an API call fails, with appropriate user feedback.
  - Accessible design elements and mobile responsiveness.
  
## UX Enhancements

In addition to implementing the core features, thoughtful enhancements have been added to improve the user experience:

- **Loading States**: While waiting for simulated backend data, users will see a loading spinner.
- **Error Handling**: If the mock API returns an error (e.g., network failure), users will see a friendly error message.
- **User Feedback**: Success messages or notifications when actions are successfully completed (like updating a resource).
- **Responsive Design**: The layout is designed to be responsive, ensuring the app works on mobile devices as well as desktop.

## Future Improvements

While the project meets the basic requirements, here are a few potential enhancements for future development:

- **Real Backend Integration**: Replace the mock backend with a real API or service.
- **User Authentication**: Adding a user authentication flow, including login and registration.
- **Persisting State**: Implement local storage or session storage to persist user preferences or data across sessions.
- **Advanced Error Handling**: Integrate more advanced error handling techniques like retry mechanisms or dead-letter queues.


This is a clean, ready-to-run version of the project. It includes both a simulated backend and a frontend that interacts with it, with thoughtfulness toward state management, UX improvements, and overall architecture.


# Project Evaluation Challenge Requirments 

## Overview

This project is designed to assess your skills in coding, state management, backend simulation, and overall system design. We are looking for thoughtful solutions that not only meet the basic requirements but also show extra attention to user experience, clean code, and scalability.

## Evaluation Criteria

Your submission will be evaluated based on the following:
